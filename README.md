taukari

Rustic data mining toolbox.

It features 
* an interactive shell to manipulate CSV files
* a static HTML/D3 visualization (only scatter plot view for now)

CSV files represents sets of samples which have a set of numeric variables. 

Other data manipulation and visualizations to come later :)
